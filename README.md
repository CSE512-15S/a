## Top 10 Seeded Male Tennis Players

This visualzation demostrates two major portions about the top 10 seeded male tennis players. The first one is the relationship between the final match numbers of the major tennis tourments (legends) and the players, which illustrates which finals of the tourments the players attempted. The other one is the relationship between the titles of the tourments and the players, which illustrates how many titles they acctually achieved in these finals.

## Running Instructions

## Development Process

For the development process, I browsed and analyzed the initial data set, and found the most feasible and interesting part. and storyboard idea together, then reconvened later to discuss the next set of goals once we had the basics of the original storyboard programmed. In all, I spent approximately 110 hours putting this visualization together. A significant portion of time was spent getting familiar with javascript and D3.
