## Top 10 Seeded Male Tennis Players

This visualzation demostrates three major portions about the top 10 seeded male tennis players (2015). The first one is the relationship between the major tennis tournament (legends) finals and the players, which illustrates which finals of the tournaments these players attended. Another one is the relationship between the titles of the tourments and the players, which illustrates how many titles they acctually achieved in these finals. The last one illustrates the court types in these finals and the details of the players attended.

## Running Instructions

Access my visualization at http://cse512-15s.github.io/a3-liusuw-/ or download this repository and run python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 and access this from http://localhost:8000/. I recommend using Chrome for ideal viewing.


## Storyboard

### initial visualization

The initial visualization will display all the relationships between the legends and the players. The sizes of the rectangles illustrate the portions of these tournament finals and the players. For example, the finals of ATP masters tournament have the most of the players attended, that rectangle appears the largest one. Same as this, the more finals a player attended, the larger his representing rectangle should be. In addition, each legend has its unique color in order to distinguish it with others.

## Development Process

For the development process, I browsed and analyzed the initial data set, and found the most feasible and interesting part. and storyboard idea together, then reconvened later to discuss the next set of goals once we had the basics of the original storyboard programmed. In all, I spent approximately 110 hours putting this visualization together. A significant portion of time was spent getting familiar with javascript and D3.
